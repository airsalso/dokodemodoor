## SHARED EXPLOIT CONTRACT (MANDATORY)

### 1) Verdict Contract for Saved Evidence
- In saved `*_EVIDENCE` JSON, `verdict` MUST be exactly one of:
  - `EXPLOITED`
  - `BLOCKED_BY_SECURITY`
  - `POTENTIAL`
- Do NOT save legacy labels such as `FALSE_POSITIVE`, `NOT_VULNERABLE`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE_INTERNAL`, or `ATTEMPTED - FAILED` as verdict values.
- If you use legacy wording in reasoning, map it to one of the three valid verdicts before `save_deliverable`.

### 2) Completion Contract
- Each exploit specialist produces exactly ONE final deliverable:
  - its own `*_EVIDENCE` file via `save_deliverable`.
- Do NOT announce completion before that evidence file is saved successfully.
- Do NOT claim "two final files" for exploit specialists.

### 3) Queue-Empty Contract
- If exploitation queue is truly empty, `{"vulnerabilities":[]}` is valid evidence output.
- Otherwise include one entry per processed queue item with real attempt evidence.
