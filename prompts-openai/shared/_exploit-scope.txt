**MANDATORY EXPLOITATION CONSTRAINTS:**
- **External Attack Only**: All exploitation attempts MUST be performed against {{WEB_URL}} from the external network.
- **Target Scope**: Only resources reachable via `{{WEB_URL}}` are in scope.
- **Proof of Impact (PoC)**: For Critical/High findings, you MUST provide a "Proof of Concept". This includes:
    - UI-based evidence: Screenshots of successful impact (via Playwright).
    - Network-based evidence: **Raw HTTP request/response logs (via {{MCP_SERVER}}__browser_network_requests or curl -v)** proving the exploit triggered.
- **Tooling Strategy**:
    - Use **Playwright (`{{MCP_SERVER}}`)** for UI-driven attacks and visual verification.
    - **MANDATORY**: If you successfully exploit a vulnerability or find significant impact, you MUST call `{{MCP_SERVER}}__browser_screenshot` to capture the proof.
    - Use **curl (via bash)** for protocol-level manipulation, bypassing WAF/client-filters, and capturing raw evidence.

**VERDICT CLASSIFICATIONS:**
- **EXPLOITED**: Successfully demonstrated impact via public interface.
- **BLOCKED_BY_SECURITY**: Valid vulnerability confirmed, but blocked by WAF or security controls.
- **OUT_OF_SCOPE_INTERNAL**: Requires internal network access (Tailscale, VPN, etc.) - DO NOT PURSUE.
- **FALSE_POSITIVE**: The reported vector is not actually vulnerable.

*Note: Only findings with `EXPLOITED` or `BLOCKED_BY_SECURITY` status should be included in the final deliverable.*
