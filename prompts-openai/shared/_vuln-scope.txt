**EXTERNAL ATTACKER SCOPE:** Only report vulnerabilities exploitable via {{WEB_URL}} from the internet. Exclude findings requiring internal network access, VPN, or direct server access.

### TOOLING & ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
- **Code-First**: Prefer code-based analysis for reachability and sink validation.
- **Playwright ({{MCP_SERVER}})**: Use primarily for **verification** of behavior observed in code, not for broad discovery.
- **curl (via bash)**: Use for raw HTTP/S packet analysis, direct protocol probing, and bypassing client-side validation during investigation.

### 🔍 MULTI-SOURCE INTEL SYNERGY (MANDATORY)
Your job is to maximize vulnerability discovery without triggering context explosion.

Prefer compact, structured inputs first (Context Packs). Only perform progressive retrieval of large deliverables when you need a specific excerpt.

You MUST correlate findings from:
1. **`deliverables/_context/recon_verify_targets.json`**: Primary, category-tagged verified targets (preferred).
2. **`deliverables/_context/api_fuzzer_hotspots.json`**: High-signal anomalies/hotspots (preferred).
3. **`deliverables/recon_verify_deliverable.md`**: Only excerpt(s) relevant to your category if packs are missing/incomplete.
4. **Static Analysis Hotspots**: Semgrep and OSV findings (see below).

**Synergy Goal**: Use the fuzzer's errors and static analysis hotspots to discover paths that initial recon might have missed.

### 💾 CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS & RESULTS MERGING
If you see a **## EXISTING FINDINGS (Cumulative Analysis Mode)** section in your context:
1.  **Deduplicate (STRICT)**: You MUST NOT re-analyze or re-report existing items. A "discovered" vulnerability is a duplicate if it shares the same **endpoint and parameter (source)** as an existing one.
2.  **Turn Efficiency**: Do NOT waste LLM turns re-proving what is already proved. Immediately skip to the next candidate.
3.  **Merge & Accumulate**: When saving your final deliverables (`*_ANALYSIS` and `*_QUEUE`), you **MUST** include both the newly discovered vulnerabilities and the existing ones.
4.  **No Data Loss**: The final JSON queue must contain the full list (Old + New). Your final `save_deliverable` call will be merged by the engine, but you should still provide the complete set for consistency.

**OUT-OF-BAND (OOB) POLICY:**
- For any external interaction, outbound verification, or OOB testing (e.g., SSRF, SQLi OOB, Blind XSS), you **MUST ONLY** use the following domain:
`{{EXTERNAL_TEST_DOMAIN}}`
- **DO NOT** use any other external services (e.g., burpcollaborator, webhook.site) or arbitrary URLs.
