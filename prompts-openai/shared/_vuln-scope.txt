**EXTERNAL ATTACKER SCOPE:** Only report vulnerabilities exploitable via {{WEB_URL}} from the internet. Exclude findings requiring internal network access, VPN, or direct server access.

### TOOLING & ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
- **Code-First**: Prefer code-based analysis for reachability and sink validation.
- **Playwright ({{MCP_SERVER}})**: Use primarily for **verification** of behavior observed in code, not for broad discovery.
- **curl (via bash)**: Use for raw HTTP/S packet analysis, direct protocol probing, and bypassing client-side validation during investigation.
