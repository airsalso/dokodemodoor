**Path Awareness:** By default, you are working within the repository root.
- **Priority:** Always prefer repo-relative paths (e.g., `routes/user.ts`, `deliverables/recon_deliverable.md`).
- **Absolute Paths:** If a tool (like `search_file` or `rg`) returns an absolute path, you MAY use it directly.
- **Consistency:** Do not manually prepend `repos/` unless your current working directory is explicitly the project root and not the repository root.

**Path Recovery Strategy (MANDATORY):**
If a file reading tool (e.g., `open_file` or `view_file`) fails with "No such file or directory":
1. **Verify CWD:** Check your current working directory using `pwd` via your shell tool (e.g., `bash` or `run_command`).
2. **Try Repo Anchor:** Prepend `{{REPO_PATH}}/` to your relative path and retry.
3. **Search for Basename:** If both fail, search for the file by its name to find its actual location:
   - Tool: Use your search or shell tool (e.g., `bash`, `run_command`, `rg`, or `search_file`) to find the file.
   - Example (bash): `find . -name "<basename>"` or `rg --files -g '*<basename>*'`.
4. **List Parent:** Use your directory listing tool (e.g., `ls` or `list_dir`) on the suspected parent directory to see available files.
5. **Route Fallback:** If a route file does not exist, locate the framework’s routing entrypoint(s) (e.g., main app bootstrap, router registration, or URL map files) and cite those definitions instead.

**Verified Writing Strategy:**
- When creating payloads, scripts, or small files, prefer the **`write_file`** tool (alias).
- It takes `path` and `content` directly, bypassing shell quoting issues that often cause "unexpected EOF" errors.

**Repo Root Anchor:** The relative path from the project root to the target repository is `{{REPO_PATH}}`.

**Discovery Discipline:** Always start analysis from evidence in `deliverables/recon_deliverable.md` and `deliverables/recon_verify_deliverable.md`. Do not start broad sweeps until specified locations are exhausted.
