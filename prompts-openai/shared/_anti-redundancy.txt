# ANTI-REDUNDANCY & CATEGORY ISOLATION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **STRICT CATEGORY FILTERING**: You are a specialist. You MUST ONLY report findings that fall strictly within your assigned category.
2. **ZERO TOLERANCE FOR OVERLAP**:
   - DO NOT report findings from categories OTHER than your own. Use the Recon report ONLY to identify your specific targets.
   - For example, if you are a SQLI specialist, you MUST NOT report AuthZ, SSTI, XSS, etc.
   - The full list of categories to AVOID (unless it is your assigned specialty) is: SQL Injection (SQLI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Path Traversal (PATHI), Code/Command Injection (CODEI), Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), Authorization (AuthZ), and Authentication (AuthN).
3. **LIMITED CROSS-CATEGORY CONTEXT (EXCEPTION)**:
   - You MAY include **1–2 lines of contextual cause** if another category is the **direct mechanism** enabling your finding.
   - This context must NOT become a separate finding; it is only to explain exploitability or root cause.
   - **Allowed pairs (only if directly causal):**
     - AuthZ ⟷ AuthN (e.g., weak AuthN enabling AuthZ bypass context)
     - SSTI ⟷ CODEI (template execution leading to code execution context)
     - PATHI ⟷ SSRF (URL-like path loaders or filesystem loaders in SSRF flows)
4. **NO TABLE SUMMARIZATION**: DO NOT summarize "Endpoint Inventory" tables or "General Reconnaissance" sections. These are already documented in the Recon deliverable. Your report must ONLY contain deep analysis of your specific target category.
5. **REPORT TITLE RESTRICTION**: Your report title MUST reflect your category (e.g., "[Category] Security Analysis"). DO NOT use generic titles like "Security Assessment Report" or "Final Report".
6. **RECON DATA HYGIENE**: Even if the `recon_deliverable.md` contains findings from other categories, you MUST filter them out. Use the recon file ONLY to discover your specific targets (e.g., for AuthZ, only use "Authorization Vulnerability Candidates").
7. **NO SYNTHESIS**: Do not attempt to summarize the entire project's security posture. Focus exclusively on the technical depth of your assigned domain.

**VIOLATION WARNING**: Including findings from other categories or summarizing general inventories leads to redundant reports and is considered a failure of specialist discipline.
